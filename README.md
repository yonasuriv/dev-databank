## How to choose the perfect Desktop Enviroment

I will try to cover all the desktop environments that are officially supported by arch linux. The list is provided in Arch Wiki

and i will simply follow the same order. And All of these are free. These are all also compatible as they are officially available in Arch repos. So, No issues of compatibility.

### Budgie



> Budgie is a desktop environment designed with the modern user in mind,
> it focuses on simplicity and elegance.

**Pros:** beautiful and modern. mostly simple and does not confuse you much with too much configuration. 

**Cons:** relatively young and may have some issues. Not much Documentation or forum activity as it is designed for specifically Solus OS which is not much famous.

### Cinnamon

> Cinnamon strives to provide a traditional user experience. Cinnamon is
> a fork of GNOME 3.

**Pros:** light and traditional. Improving constantly, thanks to the popularity. Good amount of forum activity, as it is adopted more and more OS’s. Really easy and simple.

**Cons:** still buggy in some areas.

### Deepin

> Deepin desktop interface and apps feature an intuitive and elegant
> design. Moving around, sharing and searching etc. has become simply a
> joyful experience.

**Pros:** Getting popular due to its intuitive design. has a elegant and beautiful design. All the effects and transitions are also pretty.

**Cons:** Designed for Deepin OS and not really much Documentation available.

### Enlightenment

> The Enlightenment desktop shell provides an efficient window manager
> based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries along with other
> essential desktop components like a file manager, desktop icons and
> widgets. It supports themes, while still being capable of performing
> on older hardware or embedded devices.

**Pros:** Really modern and has more of a something to learn to use it actually. But extremely advanced than other DE’s.

**Cons:** Sucks in Arch. Has many bugs. Practically No Documentation. Kind of Abandoned after dumped by the Bodhi linux distro.

### GNOME

> The GNOME desktop environment is an attractive and intuitive desktop
> with both a modern (GNOME) and a classic (GNOME Classic) session.

**Pros:** Modern. Highly popular. Has been around for a long time and is super easy and stable. seems like a tablet interface which looks more classy. Definitely the most popular and nicely documented. good number of extensions ready to be used.

**Cons:** A bit different from the traditional desktop and can be really heavy on resources.

### KDE Plasma

> The KDE Plasma desktop environment is a familiar working environment.
> Plasma Desktop offers all the tools required for a modern desktop
> computing experience so you can be productive right from the start.

**Pros:** Highly customizable. Full suite of almost all apps from text editor to Video editor. Huge User as well as developer base.

**Cons:** heavy on resources. A bit buggy due to heavy customizable features

### LXDE

> The Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment is a fast and energy-saving
> desktop environment. It comes with a modern interface, multi-language
> support, standard keyboard short cuts and additional features like
> tabbed file browsing. Fundamentally designed to be lightweight, LXDE
> strives to be less CPU and RAM intensive than other environments.

**Pros:** The description says it all. 

**Cons:** Just the fact it is not as beautiful as the others.

### MATE

> Mate provides an intuitive and attractive desktop to Linux users
> using traditional metaphors. MATE is a fork of GNOME 2.


**Pros:** Simple, Beautiful, Customizable and everything nice

**Cons:** No Cons except looks a bit traditional.

### XFCE

> Xfce embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and
> re-usability. It consists of a number of components that provide the
> full functionality one can expect of a modern desktop environment,
> while remaining relatively light. They are packaged separately and you
> can pick among the available packages to create the optimal personal
> working environment.

**Pros:** Modern and lightweight. Has both traditional and modern looks and available to customize.

**Cons:** Not many complaints here either, but you need to tweak it to make it look more pretty.

## Conclusion

There are lot many others which are unofficially supported through AUR. A DE is more than just customizable or free, The main thing to remember is the performance and cuteness. If you have a modern Computer, then go for the first few for simplicity, go for kde for high customizability and everything and the last ones if you are using old hardware bu still want good performance.
